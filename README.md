# ⚡ RLC & RL Transient Circuit Analysis using Multisim and PhET

## 📘 Project Summary
This project explores the **transient and resonance behavior** of RL and RLC circuits using simulation tools:
- **Multisim Live** for transient analysis of RL and RLC circuits
- **PhET Interactive Simulations** for observing resonance at various AC frequencies

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How inductors and capacitors behave under transient and steady-state conditions
- The effect of **resonance frequency** on current, voltage, and phase shift in an RLC circuit
- How to visualize waveforms and oscillations using simulation tools

## 🧪 Tools Used
- [Multisim Live](https://www.multisim.com) (for RL/RLC DC switching response)
- [PhET AC+DC Circuit Construction Kit](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/circuit-construction-kit-ac-virtual/latest/circuit-construction-kit-ac-virtual_en.html) (for AC resonance behavior)

## 🔍 Simulations Performed

### 1. RL Circuit (Multisim)
- Observed transient current rise with DC source
- Tracked voltage across inductor

### 2. RLC Circuit (Multisim)
- Used step voltage
- Observed oscillation and damping in the circuit

### 3. Resonance Behavior in RLC Circuit (PhET)
- Constructed RLC circuit with:
  - R = 10Ω, L = 5 H, C = 0.1 F
- Set AC frequencies to:
  - At resonance: 0.225 Hz
  - Below resonance: 0.1 Hz
  - Above resonance: 0.5 Hz
- Recorded waveform and phase shifts
